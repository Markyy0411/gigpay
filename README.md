# GigPay: The Decentralized Escrow for Freelancers

**APAC Stellar Hackathon Submission**  
**Track:** Payment & Consumer Applications

---

## 🛑 The Problem

The global freelance economy is booming, but the financial infrastructure supporting it is broken. Today, cross-border freelance payments are plagued by:
1. **Exorbitant Fees:** Traditional platforms (like Upwork or Fiverr) take a massive 20% cut of freelancer earnings, plus hidden withdrawal and foreign exchange fees.
2. **Slow Settlement:** International wire transfers and bank withdrawals can take anywhere from 3 to 7 business days to clear.
3. **Lack of Trust:** Freelancers often fear doing work without upfront payment, while clients fear paying upfront without seeing the work.

## 🌟 Our Vision & Solution

**GigPay** is a decentralized, Web3-native escrow platform designed to eliminate middlemen and empower the gig economy. 

Our vision is a world where anyone, anywhere, can work freely and get paid their full value instantly. By leveraging the Stellar network and Soroban Smart Contracts, we provide:
- **Instant Finality:** Payments settle in under 5 seconds cross-border.
- **Zero Middleman Fees:** By operating as a decentralized protocol, we eliminate the 20% platform tax. Freelancers keep exactly what they earn.
- **Trustless Escrow:** Funds are securely locked in a smart contract. Clients fund the contract upfront, proving they have the money. Freelancers work knowing the funds are cryptographically guaranteed. Once work is approved, funds are released instantly.

## ✨ Premium Features

1. **Authentic Web3 Signatures:** Deep integration with `@stellar/freighter-api`. Both Clients and Freelancers must sign secure transactions to lock funds, accept work, and withdraw USDC from escrow.
2. **The GigPay Advantage Widget:** An interactive fee calculator that dynamically proves how much money users save compared to Upwork (e.g., $100 fee vs $0.0001 Stellar fee).
3. **Slide to Verify Captcha:** A custom, Web3-native human verification puzzle built with Framer Motion to protect the application from bots while maintaining a futuristic aesthetic.
4. **Magical Auto-Login:** A premium debounce feature that seamlessly logs users in the moment they finish typing their password.
5. **Real-Time Sync:** Powered by Supabase, the dual-sided marketplace (Client and Freelancer dashboards) updates instantly across all users.
